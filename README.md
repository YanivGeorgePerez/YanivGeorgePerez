## 👋 Hello World. I'm George.

- 👾 Formerly known as [@fknMega](https://github.com/fknMega)
- 💻 I used to mess around with servers, exploits, and all sorts of cyber shenanigans
- 🧠 That was the old me — people grow up... mostly lol

These days, I publish random public projects just for fun (and maybe a little chaos).  
Thanks for stopping by.
